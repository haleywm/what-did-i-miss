# what-did-i-miss

A Discord Bot that lets you know what happened since you last posted.

## Usage

The setup of the bot is relatively simple. First, you must setup a discord bot (https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token), and then get the private key.

Next, clone this repo and extract it and whatever, and create a file called `config.yml` containing `key: {bot-private-key}`. Read `default-config.yml` to get additional configuration options, and place these in your `config.yml` file to overwrite these values. **DO NOT MODIFY default-config.yml**.

Next, you must have installed Python 3.7, as well as pip, and gcc. Install the package dependencies with `python -m pip install --update pip && pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Lastly, the application can be run with `python main.py`.

While nothing exists at the moment, the bot startup can be automated with various tools.

The bot requires the current permissions, in order to run:

| Command         | Server Permissions     | Channel Permissions                              |
| :-------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `.whatdidimiss` | `read_message_history` | `read_messages`, `send-messages`, `attach_files` |
| `.stop`         | `none`                 | `none`                                           |

This bot works with Docker. The docker-compose file will automatically create a `discordpythonconf` volume, place `config.yml` here.


## Features

This is a bot that generates wordclouds based on messages that have been posted in the server. Users can invoke it using `.whatdidimiss Time: {num}{d, h, m, s} (Default: 6h), This Channel Only: {True/False} (Default: True)`. For example:

- `.whatdidimiss 1d` will generate a wordcloud using text from all messages in that channel in the last day.
- `.whatdidimiss 30m False` will generate a wordcloud using text from all messages on the server (that the bot has access to) in the last 30 minutes.

## Dependencies

- `Python 3.7`
- `pip`
- `libyaml-dev`
    - Not strictly necessary, but improves yaml parse speed and security
- `libldap2-dev`
- `libsasl2-dev`

## Planned Features

- More minor "fun" features
- Re-implementation of the help system in a better structured way
- In built database for allowing server admins to set server-specific config
- Config parser to ensure that values are correctly set
- Text parsing:
    - Possibly fun stuff involving markov chains
    - Functionality to load data from news articles
    - Other lexical fun
